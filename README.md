# HOW TO EXTRACT DATA FROM THE WEB, TO ANALYZE THEM

Data are becoming more and more important for almost any industry.
The problem is that, often, we would like (or, we would need) to analyze data,
but we don't have them.

So, how do we do in such cases?

One possibility is web scraping, which basically is a technique that allows us to 
extract data from the web to store them, and then we can analyze them.

In this project, I've scraped the famous website [worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info) to extract the population-for-countries data.

Then, I stored the scraped data in a CSV file and analyzed them in a Jupyter Notebook.

I've also written an article on Medium on this topic. You can find it [here](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/web-scraping-for-data-science-scrape-and-analyze-data-is-fast-and-easy-b5f02c40d2d1)

## The main ideas behind this project
If you are not "a technician" or if you just want to understand the main concepts without reading the code, you can take a look at the PDF I created:
